# CIRCUS
The CIRCUS (Computer Interface for Reliably Controlling, in an Unsupervised manner, Scientific experiments) is a autonomous control system, optimised for the use in complex, time-critical experiments such as atomic, nuclear and quantum physics. It leverages the power of TALOS (Total Automation of Labview Operations for Science) (https://github.com/drvolpe/TALOS) to guarantee stability, reliability and repeatability thanks to its distributed architecture and the three layers of watchdogs. It is completely experiment-agnostic, and it is released open-source so that experiments can freely use it to control their experimental apparati.

CERN and the AEgIS Collaboration are currently discussing the open-source licence to use for releasing the software: the code will be uploaded as soon as the licence will be approved by all parties.
